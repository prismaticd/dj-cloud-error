Report exceptions from any Django site to Google Cloud Stackdriver Error Reporting


* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

* Report exceptions from any Django site to Google Cloud Stackdriver Error Reporting
* Optional dependency on django-ipware for logging of IP addresses

Quickstart
----------

1) Configure your app to user Google Cloud project:

 * Enabled the Error Reporting api as per https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/docs/setup/python
 * Set up the required Google IAM credentials - eg set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
   as the path to a service account JSON file, for an account that has the "Errors Writer" permission.

2) Install the package::

    pip install dj_cloud_error


3) Enable the provided exception handler by setting ``handler500`` in your Django project's root ``urls.py``::

    # in myproject/urls.py
    import dj_cloud_error

    handler500 = dj_cloud_error.handler500

Note: ``handler500`` is only used if ``DEBUG = False`` in django settings.

3b) Instead of using ``handler500`` you can use a middleware to catch and send all the
exceptions to Google Cloud error reporting API. Just add the middleware in your settings::

    # in myproject/settings.py
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        ...
        "dj_cloud_error.middleware.GoogleCloudMiddleware",
    ]

Settings
========

To disable error reporting (eg in your CI/CD environment), add this to your django settings::

    # in myproject/settings/test.py
    CLOUD_ERROR_REPORTING_DISABLED = True

To configure the name under which the errors appear in add this to your django settings::


    CLOUD_ERROR_REPORTING_SERVICE_NAME = "myservice"  # defaults to "python"


Optional Extras
===============

If `django-ipware` is installed it's used to log the client IP address, it can be installed as follows::

    pip install dj_cloud_error[ip]
